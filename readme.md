# real physics

We wanted to create an engine that accurately models the real world in 2D.

## the rules

- Heavier things fall faster (duh)
- Shape affects, but does not determine weight
	- more sides = heavier
- Velocity affects weight
	- more x velocity = lighter
	- more y velocity = heavier

We're gonna use raylib to render the shapes

this is gonna be so cool (real)
